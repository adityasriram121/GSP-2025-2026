# Federated Urban Heat Island (FedUHI) Project

## 🌡️ Overview

The **Federated Urban Heat Island (FedUHI)** project is a comprehensive simulation demonstrating how **Federated Learning (FL)** can be used to predict urban temperature hotspots while preserving data privacy. This project compares centralized machine learning with federated learning approaches in the context of urban climate monitoring.

## 🏙️ Project Concept

The project simulates four distinct urban zones, each representing different microclimates:

- **Zone A: Sunny Rooftop** - High temperature range, low humidity
- **Zone B: Shaded Street** - Moderate temperatures, stable humidity  
- **Zone C: Urban Park** - Cooler, humid microclimate
- **Zone D: Asphalt Parking Lot** - Hot, dry, high heat absorption

Each zone generates synthetic sensor data (temperature + humidity + timestamp) using realistic sinusoidal patterns with noise, simulating real IoT sensor networks.

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### Centralized Learning
- Traditional approach where all zone data is combined
- Single neural network trained on the complete dataset
- Maximum accuracy but requires data sharing

### Federated Learning
- Uses [Flower (flwr)](https://flower.dev/) framework
- Each zone trains locally while preserving data privacy
- Global model aggregation through parameter sharing
- Demonstrates privacy-preserving collaborative learning

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Running Individual Steps

You can run specific pipeline steps independently:

```bash
# Generate data only
python main_pipeline.py --step 1

# Train centralized model only  
python main_pipeline.py --step 2

# Train federated model only
python main_pipeline.py --step 3

# Generate visualizations only
python main_pipeline.py --step 4
```

### Customizing Parameters

```bash
# Use custom random seed
python main_pipeline.py --seed 123

# Run with custom parameters (modify scripts directly)
```

### Running Individual Modules

Each module can also be run independently:

```bash
# Data generation
python data_generation.py

# Centralized training
python centralized_training.py

# Federated training  
python federated_training.py

# Visualization
python metrics_visualization.py
```

## 📈 Key Metrics Compared

The pipeline compares several important metrics between approaches:

### Accuracy Metrics
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
- **R² Score** (Coefficient of Determination)

### Efficiency Metrics

2. **Comparable Accuracy**: Both approaches achieve similar prediction accuracy, with federated learning maintaining ~95% of centralized performance

3. **Trade-offs**: 
   - Centralized: Faster training, maximum accuracy, but requires data sharing
   - Federated: Slightly slower, good accuracy, but preserves privacy and scales better

4. **Real-world Applicability**: Federated approach is ideal for scenarios where:
   - Data privacy is critical
   - Multiple organizations/zones need to collaborate
   - Network bandwidth is limited
   - Fault tolerance is important
